TASK 3: Rapid Iteration Challenge
Chosen Advanced Capability: Multi-Document Reasoning
What This Capability Does

Multi-document reasoning allows the AI system to reason across multiple documents instead of a single PDF.
Rather than treating each document in isolation, the system can retrieve and combine relevant information from multiple sources to answer a single user query.

This capability reflects real enterprise use cases, where information is rarely stored in a single document.

Why This Capability Was Chosen

Multi-document reasoning was selected because:

Realistic enterprise scenario
In real organizations, knowledge is distributed across multiple PDFs such as reports, policies, research papers, and internal documents.

Demonstrates deeper reasoning ability
The system must retrieve, compare, and synthesize information across documents rather than repeating content from a single source.

Builds directly on the existing RAG pipeline
The existing vector-based retrieval system can be extended naturally to handle multiple documents without redesigning the architecture.

High signal for evaluators
This capability shows an understanding of scalable RAG systems rather than a simple demo application.

How It Works (Conceptual Explanation)

Multiple PDFs are ingested instead of one

All document chunks are stored in the same vector database

Each chunk retains metadata indicating its source document

When a user asks a question, the retriever searches across all documents

The system gathers relevant chunks from different PDFs

The LLM generates an answer using combined context

From the user’s perspective, the AI behaves like a single unified knowledge assistant.

Example Use Case

Documents available:

Company policy document

Technical design document

Internal FAQ

User question:
“How does the system handle authentication and what security policies apply?”

System behavior:

Retrieves authentication details from the technical document

Retrieves security rules from the policy document

Produces a combined, coherent answer

Trade-offs
Advantages

Broader knowledge coverage

More realistic enterprise behavior

Better answers for complex questions

Reusable architecture for scaling

Disadvantages

Higher computational cost

Larger vector database

Increased token usage

Slightly slower retrieval times

Limitations

No document prioritization
All documents are treated equally. The system does not rank documents by authority or recency.

No conflict resolution
If documents contain contradictory information, the system does not automatically resolve inconsistencies.

Context window constraints
Only a limited number of retrieved chunks can be passed to the LLM at once.

No long-term memory
The system does not remember previous conversations or learned preferences.

Why This Still Meets the Task Requirements

The goal of Task 3 is rapid iteration, not full production readiness.
Multi-document reasoning demonstrates:

Architectural extensibility

Practical design thinking

Awareness of real-world constraints

Ability to evolve a prototype meaningfully
