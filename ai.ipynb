    "1. Data Ingestion Layer\n",
    "Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer is responsible for bringing enterprise knowledge into the AI system in a controlled and secure way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal PDFs (policies, manuals, reports)\n",
    "\n",
    "Company wikis (Confluence, Notion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge bases\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal databases (read-only views)\n",
    "\n",
    "Version-controlled documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "File validation (format, size, integrity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Access control tagging (department, role, confidentiality)\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata attachment (source, author, date, version)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scheduled ingestion (batch or incremental updates)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprise data is heterogeneous and sensitive. Without proper ingestion controls, incorrect or unauthorized data could leak into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Chunking & Preprocessing Layer\n",
    "Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs cannot process entire documents at once. This layer prepares text for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Text normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning headers/footers\n",
    "\n",
    "Language normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking with overlap to preserve context\n",

    "\n",
    "Context completeness\n",

    "Incomplete answers\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher hallucination risk\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate embeddings once per chunk\n",
    "\n",
    "Cache embeddings to avoid recomputation\n",
    "\n",
    "Associate embeddings with metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Design Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are pre-computed, not generated at query time\n",
    "\n",
    "This dramatically reduces latency and cost\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings enable semantic search instead of keyword search, allowing natural language queries over enterprise data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Vector Database (Vector DB) Choice\n",
    "Role\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector database stores embeddings and enables fast similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "FAISS (local, prototype)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinecone / Weaviate / Chroma (production)\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-latency similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata-based filtering (department, role)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability for large document sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-off Consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "Local DBs are cheaper but less scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "Managed DBs offer scalability and reliability at higher cost\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Retrieval Layer\n",
    "Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieve the most relevant document chunks for a user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "User query is converted into an embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector DB returns top-K similar chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence thresholds filter weak results\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata filters enforce access control\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer determines what context the LLM sees.\n",
    "Good retrieval = accurate answers\n",
    "Poor retrieval = hallucinations\n",
    "\n",
    "6. LLM Orchestration Layer\n",
    "Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer controls how the LLM is used and ensures safe, grounded responses.\n",

    "Responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Context injection\n",

    "\n",
    "Explicit fallback if information is missing\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-temperature settings to reduce creativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM is powerful but unreliable without constraints. Orchestration ensures the model behaves as a controlled reasoning component, not a free-form generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. API / User Interface Layer\n",
    "Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Expose the system to enterprise users in a usable way.\n",
